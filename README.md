This is a website created as part of learning  python django. Here user browse through user-defined categories to access various web pages. 

    ->For the main page of the site, they would like visitors to be able to see:
	-the 5 most viewed pages;
	-the five most rangoâ€™ed categories; and
	-some way for visitors to browse or search through categories.
    ->When a user views a category page, they would like it to display.
  	-the category name, the number of visits, the number of likes;
    	-along with the list of associated pages in that category(showing the page's title and linking to its url); and
	-some search functionality (via Bing's Search API)to find other pages that can can be linked to this category.
    ->For a particular category, the client would like the name of the catgegory to be recorded, the number of times each category pages has been visited.
    ->Each category should be accessible via a readable URL - for example, /rango/category/python.
    ->Only registered users will be able to search and add pages to categories. And so, visitors to the site should be able to register for an account.
